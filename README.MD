### Python Fundamentals Assessment: Conditional Statements, Data Types & Loops

### Project Overview

This repository contains 15 stand-alone Python scripts created to fulfill the requirements of the Python Fundamentals Assessment, specifically focusing on Section Six: Conditional Statements, Data Types & Loops.

The objective of this assessment was to demonstrate a practical understanding of core Python control structures, including:

 -Conditional Logic (if, elif, else, match-case)

 -Iteration (for loops and while loops)

 -Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)

 -Input Handling (Type Casting and Validation)

Each script is designed to be runnable independently and solves a specific problem statement from the assessment, validating proficiency in building robust and responsive Python programs.
